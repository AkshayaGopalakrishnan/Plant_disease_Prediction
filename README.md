# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture  

### 📌 Overview  
This project leverages **ensemble learning** to improve the accuracy of plant disease detection using deep learning models. The system is designed to provide **real-time disease classification** and is built using **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.  

### 🎯 Goals  
- Develop an **accessible** and **accurate** plant disease detection system.  
- Use **deep learning models** (CNN, ResNet, Inception-ResNet, VGG) for classification.  
- Apply **ensemble learning** (majority voting) to enhance prediction accuracy.  
- Deploy a **real-time** and **user-friendly** web application for farmers.

🧠 Model Architecture
The system utilizes an ensemble of deep learning models:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
ResNet (Residual Networks)
Inception-ResNet (Hybrid model)
VGG (Visual Geometry Group model)
Ensemble learning is applied using majority voting, where multiple models predict the disease, and the most common prediction is considered the final output.

📸 Sample Output
Below is an example of how the system predicts plant diseases:


📊 Sample Predictions
The system classifies plant diseases into multiple categories, such as:

Apple Scab, Black Rot, Healthy Apple, etc.
Tomato Early Blight, Tomato Mosaic Virus, etc.

🎯 Future Enhancements
Expand dataset for better generalization.
Integrate mobile app for easier accessibility.
Improve model optimization using pruning and quantization.
